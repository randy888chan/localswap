# Unified Crypto Exchange

## Project Overview

The Unified Crypto Exchange is a platform that combines P2P crypto-to-fiat trading with a cross-chain DEX and aggregator. The goal is to provide a seamless experience for users, eliminating the need to switch between multiple applications.

## Features

- **Landing Page:** A user-friendly landing page that guides users based on their needs (buy/sell crypto with fiat or swap between cryptocurrencies).
- **P2P Trading:** Integration of LocalCoinSwap's P2P functionality, allowing users to buy and sell crypto with fiat using various payment methods.
- **Cross-Chain DEX & Aggregator:** Integration of Rango Exchange's features, enabling users to swap tokens across different blockchains.
- **User Dashboard:** A dashboard for users to track their transaction history, balances, and other relevant information.
- **Dynamic Landing Pages:** Programmatically generated landing pages based on product offerings and user geography (for SEO and targeted marketing).
- **Multilingual Support:** Dynamic translation of content, potentially leveraging LLMs for content generation and translation, with caching for performance.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js (with Tailwind CSS)
- **Database System:** Cloudflare Workers KV or D1
- **Version Control, Testing, and Deployment:** GitHub (including GitHub Actions for CI/CD)
