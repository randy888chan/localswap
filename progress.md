## Technology Pivot (Date: YYYY-MM-DD) - Action Required for Next Tasks

**A decision has been made to pivot the technology stack for the cross-chain DEX aggregator and user wallet/authentication components.**

*   **DEX Aggregator:** Moving from Rango Exchange to a combination of **ZetaChain** (for omnichain smart contract capabilities) and **Thorchain (via XChainJS)** (for cross-chain liquidity).
*   **Wallet & Authentication:** Adopting **Particle Network** for Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS), social/email logins, and potential Account Abstraction (AA) features.

**The `AGENTS.md` file has been updated to reflect this new direction and provides strategic guidance for these integrations.**

**Impact on Progress:**
*   Tasks related to Rango integration under "Milestone 1.3" (specifically 1.3.5, 1.3.6, 1.3.7) are now considered complete in the context of the *previous* architecture. Future work will focus on the new stack.
*   The planning and assessment for this technology pivot are now complete.

**Next Steps & Progress on New Technology Stack:**

*   **Task: Project Setup and Initial Refinement for New Tech Stack**
    *   [x] Review `project.md` and update for Particle Network, ZetaChain, Thorchain/XChainJS.
    *   [x] Identify and add missing SDKs to `package.json` (`@xchainjs/xchain-bsc`, `@xchainjs/xchain-avax`, `@xchainjs/xchain-cosmos`, `@xchainjs/xchain-thorchain`).
    *   [x] Run `npm install` to update dependencies.
*   **Task: Integrate Particle Network for User Authentication and Wallet Management.**
    *   [x] Review existing `lib/particle.ts` and `components/ParticleAuthContext.tsx`.
    *   [x] Confirm core logic for Particle Auth (social/email login) and Particle Connect (WaaS/external wallets) is in place.
    *   [x] Refine `disconnectWallet` logic in context.
    *   [x] Verify UI components (`Header.tsx`) integrate with the context for login, user info display, and wallet actions.
    *   [x] Confirm session management is handled by Particle SDKs and context rehydration.
*   **Task: Implement Core Swap Functionality with Thorchain via XChainJS.**
    *   [x] Review existing `src/services/ThorchainService.ts`.
    *   [x] Confirm service structure for client management, asset handling, quotes, approvals, swap execution, and status tracking.
    *   [x] Implement stricter decimal handling in `getAssetDecimals`, `getSwapQuote`, and `getAvailableAssets`.
    *   [x] Review `app/dex/page.tsx` for integration with `ThorchainService`, including signer injection from Particle context.
    *   [ ] Address full non-EVM source asset swap capabilities (requires deeper Particle integration for non-EVM signing).
*   **Task: ZetaChain Integration - Initial Research & Basic Setup.**
    *   [x] Review existing `src/services/ZetaChainService.ts`.
    *   [x] Confirm service structure for client initialization, listing ZRC-20s (`listSupportedForeignCoins`), asset deposits (`depositAssetToZetaChain`), basic ZRC-20 swap quotes, and CCTX tracking.
    *   [x] Add `formatUnits` import.
    *   [x] Review `app/dex/page.tsx` for basic ZetaChain service integration (displaying ZRC-20s).
*   **Task: Refactor Existing P2P and Dashboard Features.**
    *   [x] Confirm LocalCoinSwap P2P (read-only parts) remain operational with no immediate changes needed for Particle integration.
    *   [x] Update User Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to display user/wallet info from Particle context.
    *   [x] Simulate Thorchain transaction history display in Dashboard UI (actual data requires backend).
*   **Task: Advanced ZetaChain Integration (Omnichain Smart Contracts - Conceptual).**
    *   [x] Outline "Swap and Call" use case.
    *   [x] Enhance `ZetaChainService.ts` with structured (placeholder) methods for `executeZRC20Swap` and `callRemoteContractWithMessage`.
    *   [ ] Full implementation of advanced ZetaChain methods (requires specific SDK deep-dive and testing environment).
    *   [ ] Design and develop custom omnichain smart contracts on ZetaChain (if specific use cases are finalized and require them).
*   **Task: Comprehensive Testing (Conceptual Outline & Initial Unit Tests).**
    *   [x] Review existing unit tests for services.
    *   [x] Add unit test outline for `ThorchainService.checkAndRequestApproval`.
    *   [x] Develop further unit tests for `ThorchainService` (including non-EVM `executeSwap` path) and `ZetaChainService` (quote, ZRC20 swap, deposit).
    *   [ ] Develop unit tests for UI components (`Header.tsx`, `DexPage.tsx`).
    *   [x] Define and (conceptually) prepare for integration tests (Particle Auth -> Service flows, Thorchain EVM & Non-EVM swaps, ZetaChain operations). *Actual execution pending manual testing.*
    *   [ ] Define and (conceptually) prepare for E2E tests (login, P2P, swap flows).

### Integration Test Cases (Conceptual - Requires Manual Execution):

*   **Thorchain Swaps:**
    *   [ ] EVM (ETH) to EVM (ERC20 on ETH)
    *   [ ] Bitcoin (L1) to EVM (ETH) - *Depends on full Particle non-EVM signing for PSBTs*
    *   [ ] EVM (ETH) to Bitcoin (L1)
    *   [ ] Cosmos (ATOM) to EVM (ETH) - *Depends on full Particle non-EVM signing for Cosmos SignDoc*
*   **ZetaChain Operations:**
    *   [ ] List ZRC20 Assets
    *   [ ] Deposit EVM asset (e.g., ETH) to ZetaChain (becomes ZRC20)
    *   [ ] Swap between ZRC20s on ZetaChain (e.g., ZRC20-ETH to ZRC20-BTC) - *Requires DEX router info & UI*
*   **Particle Network:**
    *   [ ] Login/Logout with various methods.
    *   [ ] Connect/Disconnect EVM wallets.
    *   [ ] Connect/Disconnect non-EVM wallets (Bitcoin, Cosmos) and verify address retrieval.
