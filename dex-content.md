Objective**: Launch a functional P2P exchange with cross-chain swaps, basic SEO, and English/Spanish support.

#### **1.1 Core Infrastructure**

- **LocalCoinSwap Integration**:
  - Implement **non-custodial P2P trading** using LocalCoinSwap’s Substrate multisig escrow system for secure, trustless trades .
  - Use the `substrate-multisig-reference` repo to handle Kusama/Polkadot transactions and escrow logic .
- **Rango SDK Integration**:
  - Add cross-chain swaps (e.g., MATIC→USDC on Osmosis via Axelar) using Rango’s aggregation API, which batches swaps and bridges into single transactions .
  - Enable support for 70+ blockchains (EVM, Cosmos, Solana) using Rango’s `rango-sdk-basic` .

#### **1.2 User Acquisition & SEO**

- **Multi-Language Landing Pages**:
  - Use Next.js `app` router with `next-intl` for English/Spanish content, optimized for keywords like “cross-chain swaps” and “P2P crypto trading” .
  - Generate SEO-friendly metadata and JSON-LD schemas for each language variant .
- **Social Proof & Content**:
  - Auto-post trade success stories and tutorials on Twitter/LinkedIn using HuggingFace’s image API for visuals (e.g., infographics comparing Rango vs. competitors).
